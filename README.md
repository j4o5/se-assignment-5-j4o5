     Advantages of Using the Integrated Terminal Compared to an External Terminal
      1. Seamless Integration with VS Code
          Context Awareness:
             The integrated terminal operates within the context of the currently open project. This means you don’t need to navigate to the project directory manually as the terminal opens in the root of your workspace by default.
          File Path Awareness:
             It automatically recognizes and adapts to the file paths and directories of the currently open workspace, reducing the need for manual navigation.
      2. Convenient Multitasking
          Multiple Terminals:
             You can open multiple terminal instances, each with its own session and environment, and easily switch between them.
             Splitting terminals allows side-by-side execution of different commands, enhancing multitasking.
          Inline Execution:
             Commands can be executed alongside your code editor, making it easier to test and run scripts, compile code, and view output without switching windows.
      3. Enhanced Productivity and Workflow Integration
          Quick Access:
             Opening and switching between terminals is quick and doesn’t disrupt your workflow. This speeds up tasks such as running build scripts, testing, or version control operations.
          Task Integration:
             VS Code integrates tasks with the terminal, allowing for the automated running of build scripts, tests, and other commands directly from the editor.
      4. Customization and Consistency
          Customizable Shell:
             You can customize the terminal to use different shells (e.g., Bash, Zsh, PowerShell), ensuring consistency with your development environment.
          Profile Management:
             Terminal profiles let you configure different environments and easily switch between them, maintaining a consistent workflow across projects.
      5. Shared Workspace Environment
          Unified Development Environment:
             Having the terminal within the same window as your code editor keeps everything in one place, creating a cohesive development environment.
          No Context Switching:
             You can keep your focus within a single window, reducing the mental load and time lost in context switching between different applications.
      6. Rich Integration Features
          Code Integration:
             Output from the terminal can be linked to your code files, making it easy to trace errors or results back to the source code.
          VS Code Commands:
             You can execute VS Code-specific commands from the terminal, like code . to open the current directory in VS Code or code --install-extension to install an extension.
